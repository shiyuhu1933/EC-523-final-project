# Masked Face Recognition based on IResNet and ResSaNet
------------

- Introduction 

During the pandemic, wearing masks makes it much more difficult for face recognition. In this way, it is necessary to improve the performance of face recognition of users. In this project, our task is to generate a feature extraction backbone called Residual Networks, for example, IResNet and ResSaNet. By using Residual Networks, it would be able to integrate the self-attention module and CNN into the same network.  In this project, it would be difficult to capture discriminative features for face recognition. An additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) would also be introduced to face this challenge.

- Dataset

The dataset we used is MS1M-RetinaFace, which containing over 10 million images of nearly 100,000 individuals. In addition, we add masks to the images in MS1M-RetinaFace by using the MaskTheFace toolkit. About 8% of total images are added masks successfully. The number of masked face images for each individual ranges from 0 to 180. To get a relatively large dataset, we keep images of the individual who has more than 100 masked face images. Besides, data augmentation is implemented by rotating and flipping the images. The cleaned dataset contains around 400 classes and ~60,000 images. 90% of the data is classified as training data and the rest is classified as testing data. 

- Dataset Processing (Adding Masks Installation)
- Steps to install MaskTheFace
We recommend to [make a new virtual environment](https://towardsdatascience.com/setting-up-python-platform-for-machine-learning-projects-cfd85682c54b) with Python 3 and install the dependencies. 
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/aqeelanwar/MaskTheFace.git
```

- Install required packages
The provided requirements.txt file can be used to install all the required packages. Use the following command

```
cd MaskTheFace
pip install â€“r requirements.txt
```

This will install the required packages in the activated Python environment.

- How to run MaskTheFace

```
cd MaskTheFace
