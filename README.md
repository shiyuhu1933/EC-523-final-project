# Masked Face Recognition based on IResNet and ResSaNet
------------

- Introduction 

Wearing masks during a pandemic makes face identification much more difficult. In this case, it is vital to improve user face recognition performance. Our aim in this project is to generate a feature extraction backbone called Residual Networks, for example, IResNet and ResSaNet. By using Residual Networks, it would be able to integrate the self-attention module and CNN into the same network.  In this project, it would be difficult to capture discriminative features for face recognition. An additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) would also be introduced to face this challenge.

- Dataset

The dataset we used is MS1M-RetinaFace, which containing over 10 million images of nearly 100,000 individuals. In addition, we add masks to the images in MS1M-RetinaFace by using the MaskTheFace toolkit. About 8% of total images are added masks successfully. The number of masked face images for each individual ranges from 0 to 180. To get a relatively large dataset, we keep images of the individual who has more than 100 masked face images. Besides, data augmentation is implemented by rotating and flipping the images. The cleaned dataset contains around 400 classes and ~60,000 images. 90% of the data is classified as training data and the rest is classified as testing data. 

- Dataset Processing (Adding Masks Installation)
- Steps to install MaskTheFace
We recommend to [make a new virtual environment](https://towardsdatascience.com/setting-up-python-platform-for-machine-learning-projects-cfd85682c54b) with Python 3 and install the dependencies. 
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/aqeelanwar/MaskTheFace.git
```

- Install required packages
The provided requirements.txt file can be used to install all the required packages. Use the following command

- Loss

ArcFace loss is a loss function used in face recognition tasks. It is the proposed based on softmax loss.

- Results


For all the models, we set the learning rate to 0.05, the optimizer to SGD, and the weight decay to 5e-4.By training the different Residual models with the same number of batches 512 on the Masked-Face Datasets, we could get the accuracy as follows:

| Model         | Accuracy      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ResNet        | 89.62%        | 
| IResNet-50    | 89.89%        |
| IResNet-100   | 89.07%        |
| ResSaNet-50   | 90.17%        |
| ResSaNet-100  | 92.08%        |


By training the baseline model IResNet-50 on two datasets, we got the accuracy as follows:

| Datasets       | Accuracy      |
| -------------  | ------------- |
| Masked-Face    | 89.90%        | 
| Non-Masked-Face| 94.94%        |
